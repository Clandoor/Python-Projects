Dear [NAME],

Happy birthday to an employee (and friend) who have been relentless in pursuing the best choices for their team.
So thanks for being the company's most prominent advocate and, most of all, building everyone's spirits up in the terrible, terrible days.
May every day of your life be filled with happiness because you deserve it more than anyone else.

Finally, happy birthday!

Best Regards,

The HR Team

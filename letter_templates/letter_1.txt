Dear [NAME],

A good employee is rare. A great employee is a myth.
Except for the fact that we discovered the latter in you.
We all see you as being an integral part of our business and team.
May this birthday usher in a new era of harmony, joy, and fortune for you.

Warm greetings on your birthday!

Best Regards,

The HR Team
